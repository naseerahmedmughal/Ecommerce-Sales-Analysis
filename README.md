# E-Commerce Sales Analysis & Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed a 50,000-row retail transaction dataset to identify sales trends and built a Random Forest model to predict customer churn. The goal was to help the marketing team target at-risk customers and improve retention.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Visualization:** PowerBI, Matplotlib
* **Database:** SQL

## 📊 Key Insights
1.  **Churn Risk:** Customers with payment failures are **60% more likely** to churn.
2.  **Sales Patterns:** Highest revenue occurs in December, but January sees a **40% return rate** due to sizing issues.
3.  **Model Accuracy:** Achieved **85% accuracy** in predicting churners.
